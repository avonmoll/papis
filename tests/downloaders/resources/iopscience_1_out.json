  "abstract": "\nIn the temperature range from 2 to 30 K a comparison has been made of a magnetic thermometer based on the magnetic susceptibilities of manganous ammonium sulfate (MAS) and gadolinium molybdate (GM) with the readings of a germanium resistance thermometer. The magnetic susceptibility was measured by a screened selfchecking mutual inductance bridge with an uncertainty of the relative measurements being not worse that ±5 × 10-6. The magnetic thermometer sensitivity near 30 K is 0.3 mK with MAS and 0.07 mK with GM. The magnetic thermometer was calibrated in terms of the IPTS-68 and T58 temperature scale with an uncertainty of ±0.5 mK. The magnetic temperature scale was determined using the MAS data obtained in three experimental runs and GM data taken in two runs. The scale was transferred on a germanium resistance thermometer with a root-mean-square deviation of the data from the smooth curve of 0.7 mK. The inconsistency previously reported in the literature between the IPTS-68 and the T58 temperature scale has been confirmed. The helium normal boiling point temperature on the T58 scale is according to our data too low and must be raised by 9.5 ± 1.5 mK. An indirect comparison of our magnetic temperature scale with the results obtained by Van Rijn and Durieux as well as with those by Cetas and Swenson has been carried out in terms of the NBS P 2-20 K scale. The estimated difference between our data and the results of the above authors does not exceed ±3 mK. ",
